Spockworkshop
=============

A workshop to help people start using Spock (a groovy test framework) during your lunchbreak.

Build the project in intelliJ IDEA, delete the tests I wrote and write them yourself.

There is :
 - Spock documentation at the project root 
 - Tests that should have their contents deleted before running your workshop (see BasicAccountTest and others)


TO START
- install the intelliJ Spock plugin for syntax highlighting



ME
 - list the valid GWTE scenarios
